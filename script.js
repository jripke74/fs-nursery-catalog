// Step 1
// In this workshop, you'll build a plant nursery catalog while
// practicing JavaScript's Map and Set objects.

// To represent each plant in your catalog, you'll use objects,
// each with three properties:

// commonName, the common name of the plant
// scientificName, the scientific name (or latin name) of the plant
// cultivar, the variety of the plant
// Start by creating an object with the three properties above for
// the Spanish lavender (scientific name Lavandula stoechas) of a
// cultivar called Ballerina and assign it to a variable named
// ballerina.

const ballerina = {
  commonName: "Spanish lavender",
  scientificName: "Lavandula stoechas",
  cultivar: "Ballerina",
};

// Step 2
// Now create another object, with the same three properties, to
// represent another cultivar of spanish lavender called Pretty Polly,
// and assign it to a variable named prettyPolly.

const prettyPolly = {
  commonName: "Spanish lavender",
  scientificName: "Lavandula stoechas",
  coltivar: "Pretty Polly",
};
